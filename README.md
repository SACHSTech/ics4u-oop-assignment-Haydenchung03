## Summary

The diagram that I have created shows a picture of how the user can navigate through this swimming students portal where workers, students and parents can search up their name and get some general information through it. The class is the parent class which is then connected to three child classes. The parent class is the people class which provides information like first name, last name, level and lane number. The child classes are the one that inherits properties from the parent class but also have properties of their own that the parent class does not. This is known as inheritance as the child classes inherit properties from the parent class. For example, the worker class shows the amount of money they make which is different from the people class. There is also an aggregation relationship through the organizer class as the organizer class relates back to the three parent classes since this is where information and data is inputted and then printed out. In other words, the organizer has-a teacher, student and worker within that class as it inputs information into those subclasses to get an output.
